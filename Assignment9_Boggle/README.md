#My Solution
I implement optimizations mentioned in [checklist](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/checklists/boggle.html)
except the third one.  
Still missing 2 points on performance, tried the third one, which makes ratio from 2.45 to 2.20 but not good enough.
And it make code less readable so I remove this one.
